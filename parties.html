<div id="col1"><font face="arial, helvatica" size="2"><p>Festivals, carnivals and traditional ceremonies are a celebration of play and social free-wheeling. They have always been a chance for the masses to bend the rules slightly, to satarise and subvert the social order.</p><p>They have kept people in touch with each other for centuries, providing a focus and identity, mapping out the year. Dance is used at such gatherings to promote social cohesion and harmony with the environment.</p><p>The free party scene in the UK evolved from the festival circuit of the 60's and 70's. Which were essentially the hippy generation's rediscovery of Britain's traditional Summer celebrations.</p></font></div>
<div id="col2"><font face="arial, helvatica" size="2"><p>The abrupt arrival of Acid House in the late 80's caught the government off guard. Thousands of people were enjoying themselves, listening to music that nobody had ever heared of before, and they were doing it for <strong>free</strong>.</p></font></div>

<div id="col3"><font face="arial, helvatica" size="2"><p>Free parties go against the institutional grain. Governments don't like freeness because it threatens their power and gives the masses funny ideas about what life's all about. The corporate world doesn't like freeness either, for obvious reasons.</p><p>The Government stamped on the free party scene with intense ferocity. The happy smiley ravers in their fluoro smiley T-shirts were treated like cultural terrorists intent on destroying British values.</p><p>Later the CJA dealt some of it's most draconian blows out to the free party scene, but like all aspects of DiY Culture, this has only served to make it more determined.</p></font></div>
