<div id="col1"><font face="arial, helvatica" size="2"><p>Direct action is about taking control of every aspect of our own lives; the homes we build, the food we eat, the way we travel, the culture we enjoy, the games we play. It's not just about the occasional protest but about taking power away from the politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats, destroying their hold over us, and participating immediately and directly in radical social and ecological change.</p><p>Direct action in Britain is seen as a new cultural phenomenon, but throughout history, whenever the common herd have felt disafected and impotent, or have been legislated against, they have taken to the streets to voice their disgust.</font></div>

<div id="col2"><font face="arial, helvatica" size="2"><p>The notion of direct action as 'single issue' is rapidly being dispelled. Animal rights issues are intimately tied to other environmental issues, of which roads are a small part. Anti-roads activists have always used roads merely as a symbol for the socio-political machine which supports them.</p><p>The green movement has undergone a renaisance; no longer just a bunch of curly haired liberal whiners, but a socio-political force fighting againts every facet of Capitalism. Not intent to use the inefective channels of the capitalist system, it has decided to act on its own volition.</p><p>The peasants are revolting.</p></font></div>
